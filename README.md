## reflection questions
1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration? If you did not get to Iteration 3, reflect on how you think you wouldâ€™ve approached the design and problem solving process.
- We tried pseudo coding following the directions on the website to start. 
- After things grew to be a little bulky and awkward, we decided to use a flow chart to get a big picture understanding of how smaller methods might interact. 
- Once we thought we were in a good spot, we followed the deliverables checklist at the bottom of the page. 

2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
- We would like to add computer intelligence because the game is a little too easy as it is. 
- Refactoring and organizing methods and classes, after seeing how they interact. 
- It seemed like there were chances to integrate modules or class methods, but didn't have enough time to learn and implement. 
- Other features we are interested in adding are:
    - person vs person mode
    - additional ships/ larger board
    - user interface to be cleaner/ more bullet proof

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
- As a group of 3, we used driver/ navigator with a lead navigator and a 'backseat' navigator who would chime in if the lead navigator and driver got stuck.
- We used some ping pong but found driver/ navigator/ backseat to be our best collaboration method.
- We had success with Git Hub branching by the end of the project, although we were initially hesitant to break the project up. We successfully resolved 2 merge conflicts.  

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
- We verbally discussed feedback in group settings. 
- We kicked the project off with a detailed DTR session and revisited halfway through. 
- Setting a general project schedule at the start got us off on the right foot. 
- We were all open to refactoring each others code, and kept our common goal of successfully completing the project in mind. 
- Our team just worked well together.
